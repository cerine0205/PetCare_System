Pet Care System

Pet Care System is a WinForms-based desktop application developed as part of the Programming III (COCS307) course.
The project transforms a console-based pet management system into a full graphical user interface, focusing on usability, organization, and clean design.

Project Objective

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and organized system that allows users to manage their pets easily without using console commands.

Features
 • Add new pets
 • Edit existing pet information
 • Delete pet records
 • Search pets by name
 • Interact with pets (feed or play)
 • View all stored pets

GUI Design
 • Panel-based layout separating each feature
 • Clear buttons and labeled inputs
 • Consistent color theme for readability
 • Error messages and validation feedback

Technical Overview
 • Built using C# WinForms
 • Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
 • Event-driven architecture
 • Central PetManager class to manage data
 • Input validation and error handling across all features

Team Members
 • Cerine Aljahdali
 • Jana Alharbi
 • Hajer Alabbas

Limitations
 • Pet data is stored in memory only and resets when the application closes
 • Limited interaction options (feeding and playing only)
 • No user accounts or persistence

Future Enhancements
 • Integrate a database (e.g., SQLite)
 • Add advanced pet interactions (training, grooming, health monitoring)
 • Implement user accounts and login system

Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical experience in:
 • GUI development
 • Software design
 • Debugging
 • Team collaboration using GitHub

A complete and well-structured WinForms application that fulfills all course requirements.
